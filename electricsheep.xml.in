  <_description>Electric Sheep is a distributed screen-saver that harnesses idle computers into a render farm with the purpose of animating and evolving artificial life-forms.  It requires a high-bandwidth, always-on connection to the internet such as DSL or cable-modem.

The first time it runs, it normally takes about 10 minutes before a sheep (as the animations are called) is downloaded and displayed.  After that, it should come up immediately.  You can use BitTorrent to download more sheep faster, see the web site below for how.

The shepherds (those who wrote the software and run the server) use some of the sheep for commercial purposes in order to support the network and develop it further.  For example there's the Spotworks DVD, and "Dreams in High Fidelity", a painting that evolves.  Some jobs rendered by the network may be for images or animations which are not sheep at all, and will not appear in the screen-saver.

Users may not subvert the protocol of the sheep server.  If you want to change how the client communicates with the server, contact the server's administrators first.

Use "electricsheep-preferences" for configuration rather than the panel on the left.
